# Week 1: Laser Cutting #
## Week of 09/05/2024

This week, I went through the laser cutting and 3d printing tutorials and quiz. I design and laser cut a coaster with the photo of my dog. It was an interesting experience to custom make something useful by myself. 

I used 3mm plywood to make the cut and the result was really satisfying.
