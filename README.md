# Week 5 Photon2

First of all, I think one of the most effective ways to address errors appeared during flashing, is unplug the board and plug it in again, if all the other settings are ok. I struggled with errors popped up during flashing several times, and simply replug the board solve most issues. 

I started with modifying the example code we did last thursday. I played around the code and made a simple timer. 

<p align="center">

</p>

Then I started to put the circuit together. The first question I encountered was how to recognize the value of the resistors we got in the kit. I could only find one resistor that looks the same with the one on the circuit diagram. Baurzhan told me that I can calculate the value with [this website](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code). Also in many cases, the value doesn't need to be exactly the same to the diagram.

After completing the first four steps, I encountered another problem. The LED didn't blink. I noticed that the positive and negative poles of the LED are reversed in the circuit diagram. After changing the connection, the LED successfully blinked with the periodicity.

</p>

Then I started to experiment on the other tutorials. I first tried the servo. It was surprisingly easy to connect the circuit. However, I don't have the accelerometer in my kit, so I modified the code to just rotate around the servo. This actually gave me a chance to look deeper into the code, instead of simply copy and paste. I really like the servo colored the three wires so it's easier for users to connect the circuit.

</p>

Next, I tried the button send-on-change example. This is not a complicated example, but I see a lot of potentials from it.

</p>

Finally, it's the fsr (force sensitive resistor) -> RGB-led color fader. After pasting the example code, I noticed that there are some errors when compiling the code. 

<p align="left">
  <img height="500" src="assets/week5/error.png">
</p>

It shows that setTarget and setColor are not declared in the scope, and I think it's an issue related with the function prototype Jeff mentioned during Monday's class. Therefore I modified the code and added function prototypes for those two functions, and it resolved the errors successfully. Now I get to understand that although in the example we did during class, it still works without the function prototypes, there are still cases where function prototype is necessary. So it's just always nice to have it.

After solving the code problem, it works! However, I think the fsr sensor is not very stable. Sometimes it's triggered when I'm not touching it while sometimes it doesn't respond even if I'm touching it really hard. I'm not sure if it's the issue with the unstable connection.

Regarding the question what kinds of ecosystems are missing in your daily life, I think the Financial & Banking Ecosystems is missing. As I don't have any background in finance, the financial and banking system always looks complicated for me. It would be great if some AI assistants can help to explain and guide users with no knowledge in finance to learn about the wealth management process. 


# Week 4 My Interaction Ecosystems
<p align="center">
  <img height="500" src="assets/week4/map.png">
</p>

I created a network map of my entertainment & media ecosystem, which visualize the devices, applications, and platforms I used in my daily life for entertaining purposes. <br />

I started my map with listing out all the devices or objects I used daily for entertainment. The ones that I used most often are definitely mobile phone, laptop, and ipad. These are my primary devices that serve multiple purposes beyond just entertainment. The overlapping of applications between these devices (e.g., Netflix, WeChat) offer cross-device functionality, allowing for seamless transitions between devices depending on the environment (e.g., using Instagram on mobile phone outside or watching YouTube on the iPad when relaxing at home). <br />

There are some other devices that have specialized roles in the entertainment ecosystem. Switch is primarily for gaming with games like Super Mario Odyssey and Animal Crossing, while Oculus supports VR experiences like Beat Saber. These two devices are highly immersive, focusing specifically on gaming and virtual reality, respectively.<br />

Between devices and platforms, content flows smoothly. Photos captured on the camera may end up edited on Photoshop and then shared via Instagram. Similarly, media consumption across Netflix, YouTube, and podcasts happens seamlessly across my devices, showing a well-connected media ecosystem. <br />

I believe in the future, there will be more content flowing between difference devices and platforms. Or there will be less devices serving just for one single purpose, like gaming. Switch, PS5, and other gaming devices may be merged together with our laptop, computer, and finally to an XR device like Meta Orion.

This week, I also continued exploring 3D printing in Studio Foundation class. I tried the bambu lab 3D printer at the Citris Invention Lab, and the result turned out really delicate. We also learned how to use metal threaded inserts to assemble the 3D printed part and the ccrylic board.

# Week 3 Building Lampshade with Grasshopper

After exploring Rhino and Grasshopper last week, I started trying to build my own model with grasshopper. I chose to create a lampshade cause the small ikea lamp on my desk is very dazzling, as the light bulb is directly facing the eyes. 

I firstly sketched out the shape of my lamp and the lampshade. 
<p align="center">
  <img height="250" src="assets/week3/sketch2.PNG">
  <img height="250" src="assets/week3/sketch1.PNG">
</p>

Based on a grasshopper tutorial of a [parametric vase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGIqvAQRXEc), I also sketched out the rough process in grasshopper to make it easier. 
<p align="center">
  <img height="300" src="assets/week3/sketch3.PNG">
</p>

I learned many new components during the process. For example, the Revolution component is used to create a surface by rotating the curve around an axis, so I can create an annular surface as the basic shape of the lampshade. Weave takes two input lists and combines them into one single output list, so it combines the two sets of curves together to make a wavy pattern. Then I use loft to create a surface by connecting those curves. 

To make the shade perfectly fit my lamp, I imported a side photo of my lamp into rhino to check. I also measured the perimeter of each part of my lamp carefully to make sure the size of the model matches the lamp. 

<p align="center">

<p align="center">
  <img height="250" src="assets/week3/lampshade4.png">
  <img height="250" src="assets/week3/lampshade5.png">
</p>
I encountered many challenges during the process, for example trying to understand what each component is doing and a lot of debugs. However, it turns out the biggest challenge is printing this model out. It failed several times because the shape of the bottom is very wavy and tortuous. And finally, it succeeded on the third try! Although the printing temperature was set too high, makes it very difficult to take off the support. 

<p align="center">
  <img height="250" src="assets/week3/lampshade3.gif">
  <img height="250" src="assets/week3/lampshade3.jpg">
</p>

From this project, I noticed that I should learn about the constrains of the tools and medium that Iâ€™m using, and design the project based on that. For example with 3d printer, it would be much easier to print something with a flat bottom instead of a curly bottom.

# Week 2 Experiment with Rhino and Grasshopper  #

This week I started with going through a rhino 8 beginner [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAXknDTPULE&list=PLWIvZT_UEpWXs6niI0BiWz2xMg0bHbEfs&index=4) to get familiar with the interface and functions of rhino. The tutorial was only 1 hour, but it took me more than one afternoon to follow the tutorial to finally build a chair. I managed to understand some basic but seems to be important rhino concepts during the process, like c plane, planar curves, osnap, pushpull, mirror, inset, scale1D.

</p>

I also learned grosshopper with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzmZjo2_3-M) and successfully built a box with a lid. It was interesting to learn and really helpful for understanding the grasshopper graph we got in class. 

<p align="center">
  <img height="400" src="assets/week2/gh2.png">
</p>

One very useful concept from grasshopper is brep. It appears a lot in the example file and I was so confused at first. Later I noticed that brep can be anything and in many cases itâ€™s used for make the diagram clearer and more organized. 

Another useful trick that I learned from Chuhua is that by clicking this little green button in the upper right corner, I can easily preview what I selected in grasshopper. This really helps me to understand what each part of the grasshopper file is doing.

<p align="center">
  <img height="400" src="assets/week2/gh1.png">
</p>

So with help of that, I drew out the diagram of the steps building the shape of the phone stand. 
<p align="center">

</p>

And then I started to modify the example file to replace some nodes and change the shape of the phone stand.

# Week 1 Laser Cutting #

This week, I went through the laser cutting and 3d printing tutorials and quiz. I design and laser cut a coaster with the photo of my dog. It was an interesting experience to custom make something useful by myself. 

I used 3mm plywood to make the cut and the result was really satisfying. This was also a very helpful refresh for using those machines.
