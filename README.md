# Week 2 Experiment with Rhino and Grasshopper  #

This week I started with going through a rhino 8 beginner [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAXknDTPULE&list=PLWIvZT_UEpWXs6niI0BiWz2xMg0bHbEfs&index=4) to get familiar with the interface and functions of rhino. The tutorial was only 1 hour, but it took me more than one afternoon to follow the tutorial to finally build a chair. I managed to understand some basic but seems to be important rhino concepts during the process, like c plane, planar curves, osnap, pushpull, mirror, inset, scale1D.

I also learned grosshopper with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzmZjo2_3-M) and successfully built a box with a lid. It was interesting to learn and really helpful for understanding the grasshopper graph we got in class.

One very useful concept from grasshopper is brep. It appears a lot in the example file and I was so confused at first. Later I noticed that brep can be anything and in many cases itâ€™s used for make the diagram clearer and more organized. 

Another useful trick that I learned from Chuhua is that by clicking this little green button in the upper right corner, I can easily preview what I selected in grasshopper. This really helps me to understand what each part of the grasshopper file is doing.

# Week 1 Laser Cutting #

This week, I went through the laser cutting and 3d printing tutorials and quiz. I design and laser cut a coaster with the photo of my dog. It was an interesting experience to custom make something useful by myself. 

I used 3mm plywood to make the cut and the result was really satisfying. This was also a very helpful refresh for using those machines.
